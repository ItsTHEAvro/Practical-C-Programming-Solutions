# Chapter 6
**Exercise 6-1:** Write a program to find the square of the distance between two points. (For a more advanced problem, find the actual distance. This problem involves using the standard function sqrt. Use your help system to find out more about how to use this function.)

**Exercise 6-2:** A professor generates letter grades.

%|Right Grade
 :---: |:---:
0-60   |  F     
61-70  |  D
71-80  |  C
81-90  |  B
91-100 |  A
Given a numeric grade, print the letter.

**Exercise 6-3:** Modify the previous program to print a + or - after the letter grade, based on the last digit of the score.
 | Last digit | Modifier |
 |:--: | :---:|
 |1-3 |  - 
 |4-7 |<blank> 
 |8-0 |  + |
  
 For example, 81=B-, 94=A, and 68=D+. Note: An F is only an F. There is no F+ or F-.

**Exercise 8-1:** Print a checker board (8-by-8 grid). Each square should be 5-by-3 characters wide. A 2-by-2 example follows:
```
 +-----+-----+
 |     |     |
 |     |     |
 |     |     |
 +-----+-----+
 |     |     |
 |     |     |
 |     |     |
 +-----+-----+
```
**Exercise 8-2:** The total resistance of n resistors in parallel is:
<br/>1/R = 1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub> + 1/R<sub>3</sub> + ..... + 1/R<sub>n</sub>
<br/>
<br/>Suppose we have a network of two resistors with the values 400 ohm and 200 ohm.
<br/>Then our equation would be:
<br/>1/R = 1/R<sub>1</sub> + 1/R<sub>2</sub>
<br/>
<br/>Substituting in the value of the resistors we get:
<br/>1/R = (1/400 + 1/200) ohm
<br/>1/R = 3/400 ohm
<br/>R = 400/3 ohm
<br/>
<br/>Write a program to compute the total resistance for any number of parallel resistors.

**Exercise 14-5:** Write a program that copies a file and removes all characters with the high bit set (((ch & 0x80) != 0)).

**Exercise 14-6:** Design a file format to store a person's name, address, and other information. Write a program to read this file and produce a set of mailing labels.

## Chapter 15

**Exercise 15-1:** Take one of your previous programs and run it using the interactive debugger to examine several intermediate values.

**Exercise 15-2:** Write a matrix multiply function. Create a test program that not only tests the function, but times it as well. Optimize it using pointers and determine the time savings.

**Exercise 15-3:** Write a program to sum the elements in an array. Optimize it.

## Chapter 16

**Exercise 16-1:** Write a program that uses strings to represent floating-point numbers in the format used in this chapter. A typical string might look like "+1.333+2". The program should have functions to read, write, add, subtract, multiply, and divide floating-point numbers.
